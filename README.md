How to use
----------

You need to know digitizer device input number, which is specific to every device and ROM.

Use command 
```sh
adb shell getevent -l
```
and move finger on screen. You will see something like
```
/dev/input/event2: EV_SYN       SYN_REPORT           00000000
/dev/input/event2: EV_ABS       ABS_MT_WIDTH_MAJOR   00000014
/dev/input/event2: EV_ABS       ABS_MT_POSITION_X    00000247
/dev/input/event2: EV_ABS       ABS_MT_POSITION_Y    0000030c
/dev/input/event2: EV_ABS       ABS_MT_TOUCH_MAJOR   0000001a
/dev/input/event2: EV_ABS       ABS_MT_TOUCH_MINOR   0000000e
/dev/input/event2: EV_ABS       003c                 ffffffb3
```
In your case device you are looking for has number **2**.


You can now start capturing. Download [latest scrollscreenshot binary](https://github.com/PGSSoft/scrollscreenshot/blob/master/binaries/scrollscreenshot-latest.jar), unlock screen, start app you want to scroll-capture and type (replace *2* by your device input number): 

```
java -cp scrollscreenshot-0.1.jar com.pgssoft.scrollscreenshot.ScrollScreenShot -i 2
```

If eveything goes well, you will get file `out.png` with something like:
